These symbols are designed for use with [Scryfallâ€™s Slack bot](https://scryfall.com/bots). After you install these emojis, the Slack bot will automatically start using them with your Slack team.

### Installation

1. [Download this project as a ZIP file](https://github.com/scryfall/manamoji-slack/archive/master.zip)
2. [Upload each of the emoji](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206870177-Create-custom-emoji) images to your Slack team, or [bulk upload](#bulk-uploading) them. 
3. ðŸ‘‰ **Important:** You must name the emoji you create the same as their image file name. For example, the green mana symbol in `mana-g.png` must become an emoji named `:mana-g:`. Scryfallâ€™s Slack bot will detect emojis with this name style.
4. Done!
